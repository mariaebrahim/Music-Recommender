# Music-Recommender

This project is built as a way to recommend music artists to users based on the prefernecces of other users. 

This program creates users through their usernames. They are then prompted to type their orginal prefered artists and the program reads the input of the users and stores it in a file with their usernames along with their preferred artist.

The user then has different menu options which are processed through letter inputs. These functionalities include inputing additional artist preferences, getting artist recommendations which is processed based on preferences of other users, showing the most popular artist based on the amount of users that have entered that artists as a preference, along with the amount of other users that prefer that artist.
